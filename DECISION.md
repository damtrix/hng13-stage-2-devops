## Architecture Overview

### Why Blue/Green Deployment?

**Decision**: Implement Blue/Green deployment pattern for zero-downtime deployments and instant failover capabilities.

**Rationale**:

- **Zero Downtime**: Eliminates deployment windows and service interruptions
- **Instant Rollback**: Can immediately switch back to previous version if issues arise
- **Risk Mitigation**: New version runs alongside old version for validation
- **Production Readiness**: Industry standard for mission-critical applications

### Why Nginx as Load Balancer?

**Decision**: Use Nginx as the load balancer and reverse proxy.

**Rationale**:

- **Mature Technology**: Battle-tested in production environments
- **Built-in Failover**: Native upstream failover capabilities
- **Performance**: High-performance, low-latency proxy
- **Flexibility**: Extensive configuration options for custom routing
- **Health Checks**: Built-in health monitoring and automatic failover
- **Header Preservation**: Can forward custom headers from upstream services

## Core Design Decisions

### 1. Dynamic Configuration Generation

**Decision**: Generate Nginx configuration dynamically at runtime using `startup.sh`.

**Rationale**:

- **Environment Flexibility**: Can switch active pool without rebuilding containers
- **Configuration Consistency**: Ensures configuration matches environment variables
- **Deployment Simplicity**: Single container image works for both Blue and Green
- **Operational Control**: Can change active pool via environment variables

**Implementation**:

```bash
# startup.sh generates config based on ACTIVE_POOL
upstream active_upstream {
    server app-blue:3000 max_fails=1 fail_timeout=5s;
    server app-green:3000 backup;
}
```

### 2. Header-Based Service Identification

**Decision**: Use custom headers (`X-App-Pool`, `X-Release-Id`) to identify which service handled requests.

**Rationale**:

- **Debugging**: Easy identification of which service processed requests
- **Monitoring**: Can track traffic distribution and service health
- **Transparency**: Clear visibility into failover behavior
- **Compliance**: Meets requirements for service identification

**Implementation**:

- Services set `X-App-Pool` and `X-Release-Id` headers
- Nginx preserves these headers via `proxy_pass_header`
- Testing scripts validate header presence and values

### 3. Chaos Engineering Integration

**Decision**: Build-in chaos engineering capabilities for testing failover behavior.

**Rationale**:

- **Reliability Testing**: Proves failover works under controlled conditions
- **Confidence Building**: Demonstrates system resilience
- **Production Readiness**: Validates behavior before real failures occur
- **Documentation**: Provides concrete examples of failover behavior

**Implementation**:

- Services expose `/chaos/start` and `/chaos/stop` endpoints
- Chaos mode simulates various failure scenarios
- Testing scripts use chaos endpoints to trigger failover

## Script Design Rationale

### 1. Modular Script Architecture

**Decision**: Create separate, focused scripts for different operational needs.

**Rationale**:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each script has one clear purpose
- **Reusability**: Scripts can be used independently
- **Maintainability**: Easier to update and debug individual components
- **User Experience**: Clear, intuitive commands for different tasks

**Script Breakdown**:

- `deploy.sh`: Complete deployment automation
- `test-deployment.sh`: Comprehensive testing suite
- `verify-requirements.sh`: Requirements validation
- `demo-failover.sh`: Interactive demonstration
- `cleanup.sh`: Environment cleanup
- `startup.sh`: Configuration generation

### 2. Comprehensive Error Handling

**Decision**: Implement robust error handling and validation in all scripts.

**Rationale**:

- **Reliability**: Scripts fail fast with clear error messages
- **User Experience**: Helpful error messages guide users to solutions
- **Debugging**: Clear indication of what went wrong and where
- **Production Safety**: Prevents partial deployments or inconsistent states

**Implementation**:

```bash
set -e  # Exit on any error
# Validation checks before operations
# Clear error messages with context
# Graceful cleanup on failure
```

### 3. Color-Coded Output

**Decision**: Use color-coded terminal output for better user experience.

**Rationale**:

- **Visual Clarity**: Easy to distinguish between different types of output
- **Status Indication**: Immediate visual feedback on success/failure
- **Professional Appearance**: Polished, production-ready tooling
- **Accessibility**: Clear visual hierarchy of information

**Color Scheme**:

- ðŸ”µ Blue: Information and status
- ðŸŸ¢ Green: Success and healthy states
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Warnings and in-progress operations
- ðŸ”´ Red: Errors and failures

## Configuration Management

### 1. Environment-Based Configuration

**Decision**: Use environment variables for all configuration with sensible defaults.

**Rationale**:

- **Flexibility**: Easy to change configuration without code changes
- **Security**: Sensitive data can be injected at runtime
- **Deployment**: Same code works across different environments
- **Documentation**: Clear configuration options in `.env` template

**Configuration Areas**:

- Docker image versions
- Active pool selection
- Release identifiers
- Port configurations
- Timeout settings

### 2. Template-Based Configuration

**Decision**: Provide configuration templates with comprehensive documentation.

**Rationale**:

- **Onboarding**: New users can quickly understand available options
- **Documentation**: Templates serve as living documentation
- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent configuration across environments
- **Best Practices**: Templates include recommended settings

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Multi-Layer Testing Approach

**Decision**: Implement multiple testing layers for comprehensive validation.

**Rationale**:

- **Coverage**: Different tests validate different aspects of the system
- **Confidence**: Multiple validation approaches increase confidence
- **Debugging**: Different tests help isolate issues
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as executable documentation

**Testing Layers**:

1. **Unit Tests**: Individual component validation (`verify-requirements.sh`)
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end functionality (`test-deployment.sh`)
3. **Chaos Tests**: Failure scenario validation (`demo-failover.sh`)
4. **Manual Tests**: Interactive validation and debugging

### 2. Automated Health Checks

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive health checking at multiple levels.

**Rationale**:

- **Reliability**: Early detection of service issues
- **Automation**: Reduces manual monitoring overhead
- **Failover**: Enables automatic failover based on health status
- **Debugging**: Provides clear indication of service state

**Health Check Levels**:

- Docker Compose health checks
- Nginx upstream health monitoring
- Application-level health endpoints
- Script-based health validation

## Operational Considerations

### 1. Production Readiness

**Decision**: Design for production deployment from the start.
